I am a PhD candidate in political science at ETH Zurich. In my research, I draw on insights from social psychology and geography to study territorial divisions in political behaviour. Specifically, my dissertation investigates how place-based identities shape political conflict along the urban-rural divide in Europe. My work has been published in the *European Journal of Political Research*, *European Union Politics*, the *Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties*, and the *Journal of European Public Policy*.
