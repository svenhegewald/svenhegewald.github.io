**Welcome to my website.**

I am a postdoctoral researcher in political science at ETH Zurich. 

In my research, I draw on insights from social psychology, sociology, and geography to study territorial divides in European politics. I focus in particular on the urbanâ€“rural divide in political behavior and the crisis of trust in places left behind.

My work has been published in the *European Journal of Political Research*, the *European Political Science Review*, *European Union Politics*, the *Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties*, and the *Journal of European Public Policy*.
